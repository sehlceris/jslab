## Array.prototype.includes

```js
['a', 'b', 'c'].includes('a') === true
```

`includes()` finds `NaN`, whereas `indexOf()` does not.

## exponentiation operator

```js
let pow = 2 ** 4 // 2 to the 4th power, equivalent to Math.pow(2, 4)
pow === 16
```

## async/await

Previously accomplished using generators, async functions are now part of native JS.
Async functions are able to `await` Promises, pausing execution until they resolve. If the Promise rejects, it is treated as an exception.

```js
async function fetchJson(url) {
    try {
        let request = await fetch(url);
        let text = await request.text();
        return JSON.parse(text);
    }
    catch (error) {
        console.log(`ERROR: ${error.stack}`);
    }
}
```
