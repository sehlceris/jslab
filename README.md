A repository of my collected knowledge about web development.

## Interview Questions

There is a listing of typical JavaScript coding interview questions, along with unit tests to determine the correctness of implementation.

To try your hand at these, simply delete the function implementations inside `practice-problems/practice-problems.js` and then implement your own. To test, run `npm start` which will continually re-test the code each time you save the file.

## Reference

Inside the `reference` folder, there is a collection of miscellaneous notes I've collected to refresh my memory about certain topics.
